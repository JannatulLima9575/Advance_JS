## The Concept of DOM

Document: The entire web page.
Object:Each element in HTML (e.g. <div>, <h1>, <a>) has a JavaScript equivalent.
Model: These objectives are arranged in a neat manner.

## Main step of DOM Manipulation:

1.Selecting: 
2.Traversing:

# JavaScript DOM (Document Object Model) - Study Notes

## 🟢 The Concept of DOM
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.

* **Document:** The entire web page loaded in the browser.
* **Object:** Each element in HTML (e.g. `<div>`, `<h1>`, `<a>`) has a JavaScript equivalent/object.
* **Model:** These objects are arranged in a logical tree structure (The DOM Tree).

## 🛠️ Main Steps of DOM Manipulation

### 1. Selecting Elements
To change something, you first need to find it. JavaScript provides several methods to target HTML elements:

| Method | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `getElementById()` | Selects a single element by its unique ID. |
| `getElementsByClassName()` | Selects all elements with a specific class (returns an HTMLCollection). |
| `querySelector()` | Uses CSS selectors to find the **first** matching element. |
| `querySelectorAll()` | Finds **all** matching elements for a CSS selector (returns a NodeList). |

### 2. Traversing the DOM
Traversing is the process of moving between elements based on their relationship in the "Tree":

* **Parent Node:** Moving upwards (e.g., `element.parentElement`).
* **Child Nodes:** Moving downwards to find children (e.g., `element.children` or `element.firstElementChild`).
* **Sibling Nodes:** Moving sideways to find the next or previous element (e.g., `nextElementSibling`, `previousElementSibling`).

### 3. Manipulating Elements
This is where you change the content, structure, or style of the selected element:

* **Changing Content:** Using `innerText`, `textContent`, or `innerHTML`.
* **Changing Styles:** Accessing the style property (e.g., `element.style.color = 'red'`).
* **Attributes & Classes:**
    * `classList.add()` / `classList.remove()` / `classList.toggle()`.
    * `setAttribute('attr', 'value')` to modify attributes.
* **Creating/Deleting:** * `document.createElement()` to create new elements.
    * `appendChild()` or `prepend()` to add to the page.
    * `element.remove()` to delete an element.

---

### 4. Handling Events
Events make the page interactive by "listening" for user actions:

* **`addEventListener()`**: The standard way to attach an event handler to an element.
* **Common Event Types:**
    * **Mouse Events:** `click`, `dblclick`, `mouseenter`.
    * **Keyboard Events:** `keydown`, `keyup`.
    * **Form Events:** `submit`, `change`, `input`.
* **Callback Function:** The function that runs as soon as the event is triggered.
