## Add Event listener
addEventListener() is a JavaScript method used to attach an event handler to an HTML element. 
It listens for a specific event (such as a click, key press, or mouse movement) and 
executes a function when that event occurs.

[addEventListener() is a JavaScript method that listens for specific events on an HTML element and executes a function when the event occurs.]

## Why use addEventListener?

    a. Allows multiple event handlers on the same element
    b. Keeps JavaScript separate from HTML
    c. Follows modern JavaScript best practices

    ## Example:
        <button id="btn">Click Me</button>

        <script>

        document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", function () {
        alert("Button was clicked");
        });

        </script>
